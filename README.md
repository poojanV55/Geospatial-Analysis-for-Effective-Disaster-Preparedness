Canadaâ€™s geography and climate make it particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, with floods being the
most frequent and costly. Factors such as heavy rainfall, storm surges, and inadequate drainage systems
contribute to these floods, posing significant threats to communities, property, and the environment across the
nation. This study investigates flood distribution and intensity in Canada by analyzing the Historical Flood
Events (HFE) dataset and Hydrometric data from the Water Survey of Canada, and National Hydronetwork
Dataset.


Using spatial techniques like Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), the research focuses on identifying
flood patterns and contributing factors, particularly in the five most affected provinces. The study employs
both non-parametric and parametric methods to estimate flood intensity. The non-parametric approach
uses point pattern analysis and KDE to visualize flood hotspots, offering insights into spatial distribution
patterns. The parametric approach explores the impact of hydrometric factors, specifically discharge values,
on flood occurrences, with a detailed analysis of Quebec. By incorporating discharge values and spatial
coordinates, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of flood intensity patterns and contributes
valuable insights for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation in Canada. We then proceeded to predict
peak discharge levels for the years 2023 to 2026, as the current hydrometric dataset only includes data up
to 2022. Using INLA for forecasting, we estimated the potential timing of floods by analyzing the projected
rise in peak discharge levels over the coming years.
